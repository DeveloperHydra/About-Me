Hello I'm Hydra,

I am an aspiring UI & Java Developer focusing on web applications and services using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I also have dabbled in Java, Express, React, and TypeScript. I also have worked with MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis for database management.

Continuously learning is an essential trait for any developer, and I like to believe I have a passion for expanding on knowledge in various areas.

If you have any questions or need assistance with anything related to web development, feel free to reach out.

ðŸŒ± Sincerly,
ðŸ“« Hydraâ„¢#8533
